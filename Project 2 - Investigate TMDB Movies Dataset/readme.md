## Introduction

The TMDb movie dataset from kaggle was selected for this project. This dataset contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including metrics about how successful these movies are (e.g. popularity, revenue and vote-average) as well as some basic information of the movie (e.g. cast, director, keywords, runtime, genres, etc.). The purpose of this project is to go through the general data analysis process and identify properties that are associated with the success of movies as well as some interesting trends, such as genre trends, over years. I am going to explore the dataset by answering the following research questions:

Part One -- General Explore:
>1. Which genre/production company/director has the highest release of movies?
>2. What's the total budget from year to year?
>3. What's the total revenue from year to year?
>4. What's the total profit from year to year?

Part Two -- Analysis of Categorical Variables:
>1. Which genres have the highest popularity/vote-rating/revenue/profit?
>2. Which directors direct the movies that have the highest popularity/vote-rating/revenue/profit?
>3. Which production companies produce movies that have the highest popularity/vote-rating/revenue/profit?

Part Three -- Analysis of Numerical Variables:
>1. What kinds of properties are associated with high revenues?
>2. What kinds of properties are associated with high profit?
